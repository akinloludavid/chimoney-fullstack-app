### What I learned

One thing i learned while working on this project is how to encrypt and decrypt data between the client and server.
I also learnt how to encrypt user data in local storage.


### CI/CD
I implemented a CI/CD process for the client using github actions. 
The workflow for the client side can be found in the .github/workflows/client.yml

### How To Run Locally

clone the repo: (https://github.com/akinloludavid/chimoney-fullstack-app)
cd into the ```client``` folder
Ensure you use Node 18 and above
run ```npm install```
run ```npm run dev``` to start the server locally.
run ```npm run build``` to build the server locally.

You'd actually need some environmental variables from me to start the local server successfully

## Deployment
The site is automatically deployed on netlify when a push or pr is made to the ``main`` branch



### API Folder

- Live Site URL: [Deployment URL](https://chimoney-fullstack-app.onrender.com/)

## My process
